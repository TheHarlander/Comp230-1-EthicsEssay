##How do working hours affect employee productivity and risk of sickness in the games industry?

Long hours is somewhat inevitable in the games industry. As a game draws to its final deadline it is a critical time for the employees to meet all their deadlines, this requires them to work longer hours and sometimes extra days, the term for this is crunch time.[1] [14]This overtime as such can last weeks and even months, meaning that some employees will be working up to 70 hours a week for this period.[18] in this report it will describe how not only does overworking employees affect the quality and productivity of their work but how it can also be a major factor in sickness, elevated stress and at home problems.[9]


The reason that this case is important is that it affects so many in the games industry, in multiple sources you can see that many talented individuals are pushed away from this work due to the intensity of crunch time. “62 per cent of industry workers still consider crunch time to be an inescapable part of their careers.” [17][18] a report released from international game developers association shows just how many people perceive this case as an unacceptable in their careers. 
A women during crunch time lost 10% of her body weight,she was originally 99 lbs and 5 feet 4 inches already already classing her as underweight to then lose this much weight is dangerous short term but could have long term effects.[6]
